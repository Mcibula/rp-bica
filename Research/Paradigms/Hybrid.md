* Symbolic sub-processing ^6dce93
	* Symbolic architecture is combined with self-contained module performing [[Emergent|sub-symbolic computation]]
	* E.g. for processing sensory data
* Fully integrated ^d3c473
	* Symbolic concepts and rules
	* Sub-symbolic elements such as
		* Activation values
		* Spreading activation
		* Stochastich selection process
		* Reinforcement learning
