* Artificial neural networks
* Information flow is represented by a propagation of signals from the input nodes
* Knowledge is distributed throughout the network

## Pros
* Flexible and robust
* Learning capabilities
* Works well on "ugly" data
* Internal representations may deteriorate with the subsequent learning

## Cons
* Missing transparency
* Complicated logical inference
* Does not require initial knowledge base â€“ it is created during the training on data

## Characteristics
* Distributed representations
* Other sub-symbolic characteristics

## Types
* Neuronal modeling
	* Biologically plausible
	* Neuron models
	* Accurate reproduction of the low-level brain processes
* [Connectionist logic systems] ^a7a093
	* Artificial neural networks
	* Not so much biologically plausible
