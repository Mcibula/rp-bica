# Cognitive Architectures

## Definitions
* "Blueprint for intelligence"
* **A proposal about the mental representations and computational procedures that operate on them to enable a range of intelligent behaviors**

## Goals
* To model the human mind
* **To build human-level artificial intelligence**
* To provide evidence what particular mechanisms succeed in producing intelligent behavior

## AI Categorization
([[@russell2010artificial]])
* System that think like humans
	* Cognitive modeling
	* Errors made by a system match the error typically made by people
* Systems that think rationally
	* Consistent and correct conclusions
* Systems that act like humans
* **System that act rationally**

## Newell's Functional Criteria for Human-like AI
([[@Newell1980]], [[@Anderson2003]])
* Flexible behavior
* Real-time operation
* Rationality
* Large knowledge base
* Learning
* Development
* Linguistic abilities
* Self-awareness
* Brain realization

## CAs vs Intelligent Software Systems
([[@Laird2012]])
* Common components
	* Memory storage
	* Control components
	* Data representation
	* IO devices
* **CAs must change through development and efficiently use knowledge to perform new tasks**
